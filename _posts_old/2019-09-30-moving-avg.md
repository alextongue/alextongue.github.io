### We'll see how far this lil blog goes.

_**Context:** 4:16PM PST, Sitting in the coffeeshop I used to work at, listening to the album Mehliana: Taming the Dragon. It's a album of music performed by pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Guiliana (hence the portmanteau in the album name). It's a rich album with complex rhythms and beautiful sounding synths. I think the actual album was recorded in a studio, but some of their live performances could be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn6gjoMUEY4)._

I'm back in California! It feels so good to be back. Classes started the day after I got back, and I had to jump right into being a grad student. I'm taking a bunch of machine learning classes to get more involved in the field, and the first couple days have been a review of classical DSP and linear algebra. I thought that this blog would be a perfect place for me to jot down topics I'm trying to learn myself.
