I fell into the audio world because I bought a used subwoofer when I was 12 years old to make my music sound more rumbly. Now, I'm a graduate student and research engineer at Qualcomm, where I do work in spatial audio, machine learning, and loudspeaker characterization. You can read more about their work <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/features/aqstic">here</a>.

I initially made this website as a place to publish some of my thoughts as I try to gain understanding of the domains of my schoolwork. You can find these posts under the <a href="https://alextongue.github.io/digest/lit/">Literature</a> and <a href="https://alextongue.github.io/digest/notes/">Notes</a> sections.

I also like buying and restoring old audio equipment. You can find that in <a href="https://alextongue.github.io/workbench/">Workbench</a>.

When I'm not blasting my ears out with sine sweeps, I like to play guitar and enjoy specialty coffee. Some of that is beginning to make its way into Workbench!

Here is my <b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwiro5y0bjgg4fc/Alex_Tung_Resume_FA19_nb.pdf?dl=0">resume</a></b>.

<figcaption>I got to sneak into a marketing photoshoot at work because they like to use our labs for their photos. Here's me looking serious. I was probably wondering if the photographers and models were interested in hearing about the spherical t-design that informed our speaker layout.</figcaption>
