# 2019, a reflection

What a year to recount.

From January to June, I finished my undergraduate studies and graduated. I only had a handful of engineering courses left, but I was finishing up some minor and general ed's. Those last two quarters involved processor pipelining for SHA256, Sharpie impressionism, happy-hour taco plates at our local campus bar, and a surprisingly warm night huddled in a winter sleeping bag in freezing weather on a hill in the middle of nowhere (thanks Noblemen).

From June to early September, I started another acoustics internship. I awakened my inner Zack and Cody and lived in a hotel for twelve weeks, where I was lavished with continental breakfast, a pool that I never stepped foot in, and room service. I learned that I will almost never grow tired of cream cheese, ham, and raw red onions on a plain bagel.

I made my first solo long-distance drive up to San Jose, where I spent time with my old roommate and some other friends. This trip involved my first Patagonia and many Keebler cookies under the stars in Yosemite.

Back in San Diego My roommate and I, along with two interns who flew in from Santa Clara and Wisconisn, won the Bose-sponsored spatial audio category and became finalists, where I tried explaining FOA to a bunch of telecom engineers. I was almost too tired to enter the hackathon, but I'm very thankful for my team and their monstrous coding chops. It must've been because we went out for burgers the night before.

I took a couple days off to fly to the AES headphone conference and heard some really cool folks talk about headphoney things; it ended up stretching into binauralization, head modeling, and physical driver modeling. Back in San Diego, I was able to check into one of the multichannel rooms (read: a wall of Genelecs), where I spent a couple late nights mixing my friend's a cappella project in HOA.

After interning, I then wrung out the remaining three weeks of my summer exploring New York. I sat at many coffeeshops, ate pastrami and bagels, learned how to stand on the subway without holding onto the handrails, and read a contemporary French romance in about three days. I took the bus to Massachussetts, visited some colleges (not sure why...), sat in a designer lounge chair that costs almost as much as a year's worth of tuition, and took the train to Princeton to see family, friends, and the best fried chicken gizzards that I never knew I loved.

From September to December, I began the first quarter of my graduate program and started this blog along the way! I got into my second car crash (involving an aggressive motorcyclist) and learned about the wonders and pains of insurance claims.

This past year held many adventures, but it was also year of big changes. Should there be a conclusive take-away? I don't think there has to be, but I've got some working ideas.
