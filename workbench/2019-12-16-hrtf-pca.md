I wrote a quick write-up on using PCA to an HRTF database! You can find the PDF here: [Visualization and principal component analysis from a head-related transfer function database](https://github.com/alextongue/miscellany/blob/master/_posts/pdf/Tung_HRTFPCA_report.pdf).

It was for a pretty open-ended class project about data analysis, and I thought it would be useful to wrap my head around some dimensionality reduction. There's nothing novel in this paper, but you could call this an implementation of [Kistler & Wightman's JASA entry](https://doi.org/10.1121/1.402444).

The quick and dirty summary is that for each subject's HRTF, the unique per-subject, per-ear mean was subtracted, and then the grand mean of resulting functions was subtracted. I then took the covariance of the final set and used its most heavily-weighted eigenvectors as bases to transform the original HRTFs. Here are some of my figures:

I used to be annoyed because math equations weren't written impeccably with consistent subscripting and subspaces. I realized that it's really hard to keep track without getting lost in a jumble of letters.
