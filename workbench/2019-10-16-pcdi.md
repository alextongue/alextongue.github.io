**September 29, 2019:** Order placed for a used Whirlwind pcDI (passive stereo DI)

**October 01, 2019:** Shipping label created, departs San Francisco

**October 03, 2019:** Package arrives at my doorstep

**October 04-16, 2019:** ...

**October 16, 2019:** I decide to open up the DI to have a look inside:

<table style="border:2px solid black; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
  <tr><td><p align='center'>
    <img src="https://github.com/alextongue/alextongue.github.io/blob/master/workbench/resources/pcdi.jpg?raw=true" width="400">
  </p></td></tr>
  <tr><td>
    They knew.
  </td></tr>
</table>

Apparently this unit was checked (probably for QC) exactly ten years ago, to the day I opened it.

M, whoever you are, you've sufficiently spooked me. If you're the head of MI6 and James Bond's boss, I've received your message. I'll get back to you about my spy career.
