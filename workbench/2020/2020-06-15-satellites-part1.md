**Update:** I started working. This might take longer than anticipated.

I just finished my first year of grad school, and I have a week before I start working full-time in acoustics!

With this last seven days of free time on my hands, I decided that it would be neat to try getting a speaker array built in one of my rooms. 

I bought nine Tymphany TC7FD00-08 speakers from Parts-Express. They're 2.5" full-range[^1] guys with a resonant frequency of $F_s=143.42 \;\textnormal{Hz}$.

Because I want to be able to treat these speakers as point sources for ambsonic playback, I wanted them to radiate as closely to monopoles as possible. So I started leaning towards making a sealed enclosure. Although their efficiency-bandwidth product $EBP=\frac{F_s}{Q_{es}} = \frac{143.42 \textnormal{Hz}}{1.22}=117.56$ was above the rule-of-thumb range of
