# 2020, so far

What has happened in the world thus far?

First, the sudden death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna. I was pretty emotional over this, even as a non-basketball fan.

Then in March, the entire world began experiencing the panic and confusion of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which resulted in the greatest pandemic since the Spanish flu 102 years ago. The world locked down right after I finished my second grad term, and everything transitioned online.

Soon after, America experienced what also might have been the biggest push for political reform since the civil rights movement almost 70 years ago. This was catalyzed by the death of Ahmaud Arbery by three civilians in Brunswick, Georgia, followed by the death of George Floyd when detained by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

At the time of writing this, the circumstances of several other deaths have gained national scrutiny, such as Elijah McClain from Aurora, Colorado, and Vanessa Guillen from Houston, Texas.

This is already a big difference from my reflection last year. Last year was deeply personal, and it seems like this year was focused around events on a much larger scale.
