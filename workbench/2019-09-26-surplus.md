I firmly believe that all universities should have a surplus department. UCSD has one of the biggest university surplus systems in the nation. I'm really glad to have found this place -- I've been through this warehouse since I started my time in college.

This time: a dual DC supply, two power conditioners in mint condition, and a Yamaha P2150C. More to come on the amplifier :)
