If you're on this page, that must mean either
1. you want to learn more about me, or
2. I had excitedly told you in person about how I just learned how to throw together a website, and you're here out of compulsion. 

Either way, thanks for checking it out.
<br><br>
I'm a grad student, and I work in the fields of loudspeaker characterization, machine learning, and audio signal processing.

I made this website as a place to publish some of my unrefined thoughts as I try to gain understanding of the domains of my work. You can find these posts under the <a href="https://alextongue.github.io/digest/lit/">Literature</a> and <a href="https://alextongue.github.io/digest/notes/">Notes</a> sections.

I also like buying and restoring old audio equipment. You can find that over on the <a href="https://alextongue.github.io/workbench/">Workbench</a> section.

I also play guitar! This was a mostly personal hobby of mine, but I recently had the privilege of playing on two minor music videos. You can see them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpHsjl9bWs0">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfH5pGiZTA0">here</a>.
