# Immersive Sound

### We'll see how far this lil blog goes.

-----

_**Context:** 11:59PM EST, Still sitting in the the living room of my aunt's apartment in Queens, NY ([from this post](https://alextongue.github.io/live-project/2019/09/16/proposal.html))._

For some context for my future posts, a lot of the papers I write about will be somewhat focused around my reading through a textbook, [Immersive Sound: The Art and Science of Binaural and Multichannel Audio](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315707525).

A colleague from another field told me that if I wanted to get acquainted with a subject, that it would be more useful to read through a textbook instead of fumbling through papers that are published left and right. As I thought about it, that's the beauty of a secondary source: Editors who have already spent years acquainted with (and hopefully contributing to) a subject matter are able to distill[^1] the research, compiling only the important bits into a collection with more authority than I currently hold. In a sense, a well-written textbook blends and distills the obscene amount of informational food that I would otherwise choke on as a research infant. I guess you can call this academic parenthood :)

I just read through the first chapter, titled "The Perception of Spatial Sound," and it did a pretty neat job of explaining our sensation of sound in space at sensorineural and physical level. I had skipped ahead to the chapter nine on the Sound Field, and I'm enjoying it. The editors do very well to explain different approaches to the umbrella of "spatial audio" (e.g. soundfield-based vs. object-based spatialization) and its ramifications in implementation for industries and end-users.

There's a PDF that I found on Google<sup>2</sup>, but I ended up buying the book straight from the publisher... I'm not sure if much of my money actually trickled down to the pockets of Agnieszka, Paul and friends, but I was too excited to have the physical copy in my hands to think about that. Especially last week, it made for good bus reading, when I was visiting Boston.

Give the book a read! I highly recommend it. If not, you could also just read through my posts as an un-corroborated tertiary source, I guess.

### Footnotes
[^1]: Here's a [neat article](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) from the machine learning world on the topic of research debt -- it's where I got the use of "distillation" in this sense.
[^2]: I'm not even sure if it's legal for me to distribute it, or for me to even mention its existence...
